<p>
Access to arbitrary websites is not available from free accounts;
you can only access sites that are on our
<a href="http://www.pythonanywhere.com/whitelist">whitelist</a>.
If you want to suggest something to add to our whitelist
drop us a line at support@pythonanywhere.com.  It will have
to have an official public API.

<p>
Alternatively, you can sign up for a paid account at
<a href="http://www.pythonanywhere.com/account/">http://www.pythonanywhere.com/account/</a>
</p>
<p>
If you have already got a paid account and you're still getting this messge,
you may need to reload your web app (from the "Web" tab) or restart
your consoles.  If that doesn't help, drop us a line at support@pythonanywhere.com.
