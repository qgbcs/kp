# pyxterm.js
A fully functional terminal in your browser.

## How does this work?

On the backend:
* A [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) server is running
* The Flask server uses [flask-socketio](https://flask-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a websocket library for Flask and socketio
* A [pty](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pty.html) ("pseudo-terminal") is spawned that runs bash.
  * You can think of a pty as a way to serialize/deserialize a terminal session. The Python docs describe it as "starting another process and being able to write to and read from its controlling terminal programmatically".

On the frontend:
* [Xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) is used to render [Xterm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xterm) output data in the browser.
  * This means [escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) used by terminals to control the cursor location, color, and other options can be passed directly to Xterm.js and Xterm.js will faithfully render them as a terminal would.
  * Output from the pty process on the backend is fed into it.
  * Input from the browser is passed via websocket to the pty's input


## Why?
The real purpose of this is to show a basic proof of concept on how to bring Xterm.js, Python, Flask, and Websockets together to run a pty in the browser.

This is a
* starting point to build your own web app with a terminal
* learning tool to understand what a `pty` is, and how to use one in Python
* way to see Flask and Flask-SocketIO in action
* way to play around with Xterm.js in a meaningful environment
